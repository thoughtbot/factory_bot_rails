# factory_girl_rails [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci] [![Code Climate][grade-image]][grade]

[factory_girl][fg] is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition
syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved
instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple
factories for the same class (`user`, `admin_user`, and so on), including factory
inheritance.

## Rails

factory_girl_rails provides Rails integration for [factory_girl][fg].

Currently, automatic factory definition loading is the only Rails-specific feature.

Supported Rails versions are listed in [`Appraisals`](Appraisals). Supported
Ruby versions are listed in [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml).

## Download

Github: http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails

Gem:

    gem install factory_girl_rails

## Configuration

Add `factory_girl_rails` to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'factory_girl_rails'
```

Generators for factories will automatically substitute fixture (and maybe any other
`fixture_replacement` you set). If you want to disable this feature, add the
following to your application.rb file:

```ruby
config.generators do |g|
  g.factory_girl false
end
```

Default factories directory is `test/factories`, or `spec/factories` if
`test_framework` generator is set to `:rspec`; change this behavior with:

```ruby
config.generators do |g|
  g.factory_girl dir: 'custom/dir/for/factories'
end
```

If you use factory_girl for fixture replacement, ensure that
factory_girl_rails is available in the development group. If it's not, Rails
will generate standard .yml files instead of factory files.

factory_girl takes an option `suffix: 'some_suffix'` to generate factories as
`modelname_some_suffix.rb`.

If you use factory_girl for fixture replacement and already have a
`factories.rb` file in the directory that contains your tests,
factory_girl_rails will insert new factory definitions at the top of
`factories.rb`.
